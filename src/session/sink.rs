//! Definitions and utilities for working with sinks.
//!
//! Sinks ("well-known flows" in terms of GRR nomenclature) are ever-existing
//! sessions on the GRR server that listen for various kinds of data. They are
//! a way to break away from the usual request-response workflow.
//!
//! For example, sinks can be used to notify the server about agent startup
//! (which is clearly not a response to a particular request) or to transfer
//! file blobs to a specialized storage.

    pub const STARTUP: Sink = Sink { id: "/flows/F:Startup" };

    /// A handle to the transfer store sink.
    pub const TRANSFER_STORE: Sink = Sink { id: "/flows/F:TransferStore" };

    /// Wraps an action response to a sink-specific session response.
